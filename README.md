This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

To start the project run `npm start`.

Web browser should start at `http://localhost:3000/`.

I ran out of time to complete the entire exercise. 

Still outstanding items:

- client side pagination
- set up redux store
